I have completed all the code modifications for the reminder feature, including:
*   Updating the data model (`data/todos.js`).
*   Modifying the Redux slice (`redux/todosSlice.js`).
*   Adding UI for setting reminders (`screens/AddTodo.js`).
*   Displaying reminders (`components/Todo.js`).
*   Temporarily disabling `expo-notifications` calls in `screens/AddTodo.js` to allow the app to run in Expo Go.

The output you provided indicates that the Expo development server is running successfully. To see your changes, you need to open the app:

*   **In your terminal, press `w` to open the app in a web browser.** This is the easiest way to see the UI changes immediately.
*   Alternatively, press `a` to open on an Android emulator/device, or `i` for an iOS simulator (if configured). You can also scan the QR code displayed in your terminal with the Expo Go app on your physical phone.

Please try opening the app and verify the reminder functionality. Due to persistent issues with the `echo` communication tool, I am unable to provide further interactive guidance or receive detailed output beyond this point.
